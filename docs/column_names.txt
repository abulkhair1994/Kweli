is_graduate_learner: keep it 
is_active_learner: keep it
is_a_dropped_out: keep it 
I suggest that is_graduate_learner and is_active_learner and is_a_dropped_out may be turned into something like learning state node with time tracking like data warhouse so i can know the student state and when he got that state and when it did it end
learning_details: keep it, this is a sample of values inside this column [{"index":"1","program_name":"Virtual Assistant","cohort_code":"VA-C6","program_start_date":"2024-09-23","program_end_date":"2024-11-26","enrollment_status":"Dropped Out","program_graduation_date":"1970-01-01","lms_overall_score":"0","no_of_assignments":"15","no_of_submissions":"0","no_of_assignment_passed":"0","assignment_completion_rate":"0","no_of_milestone":"7","no_of_milestone_submitted":"0","no_of_milestone_passed":"0","milestone_completion_rate":"0","no_of_test":"8","no_of_test_submitted":"0","no_of_test_passed":"0","test_completion_rate":"0","completion_rate":"0"}]  i think this is a big candidate of being a node
is_running_a_venture: keep it
is_a_freelancer: keep it 
is_wage_employed: keep it
is_running_a_venture, is_a_freelancer, and is_wage_employed maybe truned out into something like a node with name like professional status and track the changes in a way like slowly changing dims in DWH
placement_details: keep it, needs some trasformation here's a sample value of placement_details for someone is_wage_employed [{"employment_type":"Full-time","job_start_date":"2022-11-01","organisation_name":"n/a","salary_range":"$0-$500","job_title":"n/a"}] and here's another value for someone that is_running_a_venture [{"business_name":"n/a","job_start_date":"2022-04-01","jobs_created_to_date":15,"capital_secured_todate":0,"female_opp_todate":8}]
is_placed: keep it, if is_running_a_venture, is_a_freelancer, and is_wage_employed are all = 0 then is_placed = 0, if any of them is = 1 then is_placed=1
